# Wonnet

A bash script to connect to wireless network via a CLI, for shell lovers. The output of "wonnet-development.sh" show processes that are happening in the script, instead "wonnet-client.sh" don't show a lot of this processes. This is the only difference. 

## Test

* Download the repository
* Go to project directory
* On your terminal, run:

```sh
./wonnet-development.sh
```

* Let me know if you have any errors or problems
