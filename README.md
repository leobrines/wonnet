# Wonnet

A bash script to connect to wireless network via a CLI, for shell lovers. The output of "wonnet-development.sh" show processes that are happening in the script, instead "wonnet-client.sh" don't show a lot of this processes. This is the only difference. 

## Test

1. Download the repository
2. Go to project root path
3. On your terminal, run:

	```sh
	./wonnet.sh
	```

4. Let me know if you had any error or problem
